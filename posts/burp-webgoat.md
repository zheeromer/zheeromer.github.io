# Learning Web Application Security with Burp Suite and WebGoat

## Overview
As part of my cyber security learning, I practised web application security testing using Burp Suite and WebGoat to better understand how common web vulnerabilities work in practice.

## Tools Used
- Burp Suite
- WebGoat

## What I Practised
- Intercepting and analysing HTTP requests and responses
- Identifying common vulnerabilities such as cross-site scripting (XSS) and SQL injection
- Observing how insecure input handling can lead to security issues

## What I Learned
This exercise helped reinforce my understanding of web application security concepts, particularly the importance of input validation, secure coding practices, and defensive controls.
